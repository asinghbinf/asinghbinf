I am an enthusiastic and emerging bioinformatician with a strong foundation in biological sciences, computer science, statistics, and mathematics thanks to my interdisciplinary background. This allows me to excel in analyzing complex biological data, particularly in the areas of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. I possess expertise in data analysis, sequence alignment, and programming languages like Python and R. My passion lies in leveraging computational tools to unlock new discoveries in these fields.

In my free time, I've actively pursued my interest in bioinformatics by developing two applications. One, built in R Shiny, generates phylogenetic trees and investigates potential post-translational modifications in proteins. The other, called MAHAN and coded in SwiftUI, provides support for caregivers.
